# PDF Export Functionality Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Portfolio Page PDF export button was generating TXT files instead of actual PDF files. The issue was in the `generate_portfolio_report` callback function which was:
1. Creating plain text content instead of PDF content
2. Using the CSV download component instead of a dedicated PDF download component
3. Generating files with `.txt` extension instead of `.pdf`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added PDF Generation Library
- **Library**: `reportlab==4.0.4` (professional PDF generation library)
- **Added to**: `requirements.txt`
- **Installation**: Successfully installed in virtual environment

### 2. Created Professional PDF Generation Function
- **Function**: `generate_portfolio_pdf(result, symbols, method)`
- **Features**:
  - Professional layout with company branding
  - Portfolio summary table with proper formatting
  - Portfolio metrics table with financial data
  - Individual stock metrics table
  - Risk analysis section
  - Recommendations section
  - Professional typography and spacing
  - Proper page margins and styling

### 3. Updated Download Components
- **Added**: `dcc.Download(id="download-pdf")` component
- **Location**: Portfolio export section in `app/main.py`

### 4. Modified Callback Function
- **Updated**: `generate_portfolio_report` callback
- **Changes**:
  - Now outputs to `download-pdf` instead of `download-csv`
  - Generates actual PDF content using `generate_portfolio_pdf()`
  - Uses proper filename format: `Portfolio_Report_{method}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf`
  - Sets correct MIME type: `application/pdf`

### 5. PDF Content Structure
The generated PDF includes:
- **Header**: Title and generation timestamp
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Table with symbol weights
- **Portfolio Metrics**: Key financial ratios and performance metrics
- **Individual Stock Metrics**: Per-stock performance data
- **Risk Analysis**: Risk level assessment and diversification analysis
- **Recommendations**: Actionable investment advice
- **Footer**: Professional disclaimer
